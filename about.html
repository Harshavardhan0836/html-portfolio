<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Harshavardhan, a passionate Computer Science student with a
   deep interest in web development, programming, and problem-solving.
   Currently in my 2nd year, Iâ€™m actively learning Java, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), 
   and full-stack web development to build efficient and scalable applications.
</p>

<p>I love exploring new technologies, brainstorming tech ideas, and staying updated with the latest trends in software development
   and AI. My goal is to become a skilled software developer, contribute to innovative projects, and secure impactful internships.
  </p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me watching anime, reading manga, or discussing the latest series.
   I love immersing myself in amazing stories and fictional worlds, which inspire my creativity and problem-solving mindset.</p>
